Hi. Thank you for taking the time to visit. I'm Alex and I'm a dual major PhD candidate at Michigan State University in the Comparative Medicine and Integrative Bioogy [CMIB](http://cvm.msu.edu/future-students/graduate-programs/cmib) and Environmental Integrative Toxicological Sciences [EITS](http://cit.msu.edu/training/doctoral_program.html) graduate programs.
