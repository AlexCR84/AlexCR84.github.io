Welcome!
Thank you for taking the time to visit. My name is Alexandra Col√≥n and I'm a dual major PhD candidate at Michigan State University in the [Comparative Medicine and Integrative Bioogy](http://cvm.msu.edu/future-students/graduate-programs/cmib) (CMIB) and [Environmental Integrative Toxicological Sciences](http://cit.msu.edu/training/doctoral_program.html) (EITS) graduate programs. This portfolio is a compilation of my teaching experiences. Please contact me if you have any questions.
