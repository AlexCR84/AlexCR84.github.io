Description.The purpose of this activity is to teach the concept of synaptic transmission. The activity consists in having 3 students at the synapse, one at the axon hillock and a teacher or volunteer at the synaptic terminal. At the count of three the students at the synapse will send the signal through the rope to the  axon hillock, there the action potential will be sent by a different student to the axon terminal, where there will be a box with foam balls, that when pushed hard will touch the muscle. Then, the muscle will light up when the neurotransmitters touch it. A display board will have what the neuron is, the parts and their function. We ask the participants at the end, what happened when the neurotransmitters touched the muscle? What happens if the signal is not strong enough? What do you think happens if the signal gets disrupted or the organelles are not working?

Materials for activity:

*Wood board or thick cardboard

*Sharpie

*Push pins

*Blue and white acrylic paint 

*Paintbrushes (small and medium)

*Rope 

*3” by 2” wood
